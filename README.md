# CS311 programming assignments
This repository contains C++ starter code for programming assignments in CS 311. 

## Get started
1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/csusm-cs/cs311_assignments.git
```
The repository was organized into separate directories for the assignments.

2. Develop your program in a Linux system

The assignments are designed to compile and run on a Linux environement, e.g. the empress.csusm.edu server. You may set up your own Linux system for the assignments as well. Contact the instructor if you need help on using Linux.

## Code Comments
You must provide sufficient comments in your code so that others can understand what you have done. 
- Each function should have a brief comment explaining the purpose of the function, input parameters to the function, and output. The comments might also state the limitations of the function using possibly pre-conditions and post-conditions.
- Most variables should have a brief comment explaining their purpose. Looping control variables such as: “x” or “i” need not be commented.
- Comment your code to explain tricky and important points (not every line).
- Comments should be comprehensible and useful. Comments such as: “This adds 1 to Count” are trivial and should be avoided.
- Comments should be clearly organized and easily distinguishable from the actual code.

## Submission
The completed source code should be submitted to Gradescope. See each assignment instruction for more details.

## Guidelines for what is allowed and what is not!
### Allowed:
- Talking about general strategy including general class design and general algorithms. Though it's definitely better if you try to come up with these on  - your own first.
- Using general C++ code you find online for common operations like:
  - General input/output
  - Using the STL classes
### NOT Allowed:
- Designing "pseudocode" together such that your pseudocode is directly translatable to C++
- Even LOOKING at code which is a solution or partial solution to your assignments
- Posting your code publicly or showing it to anyone else
