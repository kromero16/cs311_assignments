//CS311 Yoshii S22 Linked List class

//INSTRUCTION:
//It helps to first create if-then-else structure to fill in later.
//- Make sure PURPOSE and PARAMETER comments are given in detail
//  Highly recommended to copy HW3P1-help as PURPOSE of each function.
//  Add sufficient comments to your code body to describe what it does.
//      - Make sure all if-then-else are commented describing which case it is
//      - Make sure all local variables are described fully with their purposes

//You must complete the TODO parts and then complete LinkedList.cpp. Delete "TODO" after you are done.
