# CS311 Programming Assignment 3

In this assignment, you will implement sorting algorithms for data stored either in an array or a linked list.

## Sorting an array
Implement the insertion sort and quicksort for an integer array. The functions are defined in the "sorting.h" header file.
```
void insertionSort(int array[], int lowindex, int highindex, bool reversed = false);
```
