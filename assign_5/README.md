# CS311 programming assignment 5
In this assignment, you will implement a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure in C++. Please add your code in into the "BST.cpp" file to complete the member functions
defined in the header file "BST.h". You may add additional functions to the BST class, but don't change the existed definitions, which are required by the testing programs.
