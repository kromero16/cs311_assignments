# CS311 Programming Assignment 2
This assignment is based on the linked list data structure from assignment 1. You must have a working LinkedList data structure.
We will implement the following two functions on input linked lists:

## Union Linked Lists
Assume two linked lists that represent Set A and Set B respectively. Implement the following function to obtain their union `A U B` and return the result as a new linked list. Note that a Set should not contain duplicate elements (e.g., integers), but its elements are not assumed to be sorted in the list. The definition of the function `unionLinkedList` is as the following:
```
 LinkedList unionLinkedList (const LinkedList& LA, const LinkedList& LB)
```
For example, if 
```
LA = (3, 5, 8, 11)
LB = (2, 6, 8, 9, 22, 24)
```
Then `unionLinkedList(LA, LB) = (3, 5, 8, 11, 2, 6, 9, 22, 24)`. Note the list isnâ€™t sorted.
## Merge Linked Lists
Assume two input linked lists, LA and LB, whose elements are both in the non-descending order (duplicates may exist). Implement the following function to merge LA and LB into a new linked list (as the return value). The elements in the new list should still be in the non-descending order. The definition of the function `mergeLinkedList` is as the following:
```
LinkedList mergeLinkedList (const LinkedList& LA, const LinkedList& LB);

```
For example, if
```
LA = (3, 5, 8, 11)
LB = (2, 6, 8, 9, 22, 24)
```
Then `mergeLinkedList (LA, LB) = (2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 8, 9, 11, 22, 24)`. Note same values may repeat
